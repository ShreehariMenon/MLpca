# 🍷 Wine PCA Explorer (Streamlit App)

This is a simple Streamlit app that demonstrates **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on the UCI **Wine Dataset**.

## 📌 Features

- Apply PCA with customizable number of components
- View scree plot (explained variance)
- 2D and 3D scatter plots of PCA results
- Explore the transformed dataset
- Download the PCA-transformed data

## 📄 About the Dataset

The Wine dataset is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine). It contains:

- 178 wine samples
- 13 chemical features
- 3 wine cultivars (target classes)

## 🧠 What is PCA?

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a dataset into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables (principal components), capturing the maximum variance.

PCA helps in:
- Visualizing high-dimensional data
- Reducing noise
- Simplifying ML models

## 🚀 How to Run the App

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-pca-streamlit.git
   cd wine-pca-streamlit
